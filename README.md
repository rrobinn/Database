I work as a PhD researcher in the [Elab](https://innovation.umn.edu/elison-lab/), a developmental psychology lab. We collect and use a ton of data from many modalities including <b>eye-tracking</b>, <b>neuroimaging</b>, and <b>behavioral assessments</b>. This repo includes helper tools for lab-mates to more easily grab, wrangle, and clean data, so that they have more time to do science.
